How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    the minus sign shows the change from the new file compared to old file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    bugs can be fixed much faster without browsing through the entire file

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: don't have to worry saving files when one forgotten to save
    cons: accidentally saved what you don't want

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because you might have edited several files at once (creating a button), while when using
    google doc, you are only working on one file at given time and autsaved before
    switching to a different file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the commits that have been made to the files
    git diff shows the different between versions (line that have been changed) that is provided

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because you can always revert back to the older version if you dislike the new changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    android development

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
  
    Version control can help revert back to the previously before bug is introduce, and/or know
    the exact location of the bug introduce and change it back manually.
